              <p>Currently I do not have any projects in the works, however I have incuded some images which will hopefully be replaced by my own projects in future.</p>
              <p><img src="Pyramid.jpg" alt="Pyramid" style="float:left;width:142px;height:142px;">
Some pyramids! How cool are they.</p>

<p><img src="EiffelTower.jpg" alt="EiffelTower" style="float:left;width:142px;height:142px;">
This is the Eiffel Tower, it's a lovely image. If I were to do a proper projects page I'd probably have an image of my work here instead, but becuase I don't have any work to showcase this will have to do.</p>
